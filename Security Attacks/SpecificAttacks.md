# Packet Sniffing and Packet Spoofing

## Packet Sniffing

### What is Packet Sniffing?

Packet sniffing is a technique used to capture and inspect data packets as they travel across a network. Network packets contain various information including source and destination addresses, protocol information, and actual data being transmitted. Packet sniffers (also called network analyzers or protocol analyzers) are tools designed to intercept and log this network traffic.

### Types of Packet Sniffers

1. **Active Sniffers**: These actively inject packets into the network to facilitate sniffing.
2. **Passive Sniffers**: These only monitor traffic without introducing any new packets.

### Common Packet Sniffing Tools

- **Wireshark**: Open-source, feature-rich packet analyzer
- **tcpdump**: Command-line packet analyzer
- **Ettercap**: Comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Kismet**: Wireless network detector and sniffer

### Legitimate Uses of Packet Sniffing

- Network troubleshooting and monitoring
- Network performance optimization
- Security testing and verification
- Protocol development and debugging

### Malicious Uses of Packet Sniffing

- Stealing unencrypted credentials
- Capturing sensitive information
- Session hijacking
- Corporate espionage

## Packet Spoofing

### What is Packet Spoofing?

Packet spoofing is a technique where an attacker falsifies the source address or other packet information to impersonate another system. By fabricating the origin of data packets, attackers can bypass security controls, redirect traffic, or hide their identity during malicious activities.

### Protection Against Packet Spoofing

1. **Ingress and Egress Filtering**: Filter incoming and outgoing packets based on source/destination addresses
2. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms
3. **Encryption**: Use encrypted protocols (SSH, TLS/SSL)
4. **Packet Filtering**: Configure firewalls to block suspicious packets
5. **Network Monitoring**: Implement IDS/IPS to detect spoofing attempts
