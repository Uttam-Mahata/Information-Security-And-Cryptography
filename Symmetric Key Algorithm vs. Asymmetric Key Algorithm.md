### **1. Merits and Demerits**

#### **Symmetric Key Algorithm**
| **Merits**                                                                 | **Demerits**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Faster** encryption and decryption due to simpler algorithms.            | **Key Distribution Problem**: Securely sharing the key between parties is difficult. |
| **Efficient** for large data encryption (e.g., file encryption).           | **Scalability Issues**: Requires a unique key for each pair of users.         |
| **Low computational overhead**: Requires less processing power.            | **No Non-Repudiation**: Cannot verify the sender's identity.                  |
| **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and understand.                        | **Vulnerable to Brute-Force Attacks**: If the key is weak, it can be cracked. |

#### **Asymmetric Key Algorithm**
| **Merits**                                                                 | **Demerits**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Secure Key Distribution**: No need to share a secret key.                | **Slower**: Computationally intensive due to complex algorithms.             |
| **Scalability**: Only one key pair (public/private) is needed per user.    | **Inefficient for Large Data**: Not suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. |
| **Non-Repudiation**: Provides authentication and integrity.                | **Higher Computational Overhead**: Requires more processing power.           |
| **Digital Signatures**: Enables verification of the sender's identity.     | **Complexity**: Harder to implement and understand.                          |

### **2. Comparison and Contrast**

| **Aspect**                  | **Symmetric Key Algorithm**                          | **Asymmetric Key Algorithm**                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Type**                | Single shared key for encryption and decryption.    | Two keys: Public key (encryption) and Private key (decryption). |
| **Speed**                   | Faster due to simpler operations.                   | Slower due to complex mathematical operations.   |
| **Key Distribution**        | Challenging to securely share the key.              | No need to share private keys; public keys are openly shared. |
| **Scalability**             | Poor scalability (requires unique keys for each pair). | Highly scalable (one key pair per user).         |
| **Use Case**                | Suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.      | Suitable for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and small data. |
| **Security**                | Vulnerable if the key is compromised.               | More secure due to the use of two keys.          |
| **Computational Overhead**  | Low computational requirements.                     | High computational requirements.                 |
| **Non-Repudiation**         | Does not provide non-repudiation.                   | Provides non-repudiation through digital signatures. |
| **Examples**                | AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish.                           | RSA, ECC, DSA, ElGamal.                          |

### **3. Summary**
- **Symmetric Key Algorithms** are faster and more efficient for encrypting large amounts of data but suffer from key distribution and scalability issues.
- **Asymmetric Key Algorithms** solve the key distribution problem and provide non-repudiation but are slower and computationally intensive.

In practice, both algorithms are often used together in hybrid systems (e.g., SSL/TLS), where asymmetric encryption is used for key exchange, and symmetric encryption is used for data encryption.
